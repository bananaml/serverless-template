# Local testing

## With docker

To test the Serverless Framework with docker locally, you need to build the docker container and then run it.
In the root of this directory, run:
```
docker build . -t serverless-template
```
After which you can run the container. Here we also forward the port to access the localhost url outside of the
container and enable gpu acceleration.
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 --gpus=all serverless-template
```

## Without docker

Testing your code without docker is straight forward. Remember to pass in the Hugging Face model name as 
an ENV variable. In this case:
```
export HF_MODEL_NAME=bert-base-uncased
```
Make sure you have the required dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
And then simply run the server.py
```
python3 server.py
```
